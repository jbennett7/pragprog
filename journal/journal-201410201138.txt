Was able to do some of the platime stuff. Most notably Activity 1.  I added the code like so:

app/controllers/store_controller.rb

  @date_time = Time.now


app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

  <li><%= @date_time %></li>

The color needed to be adjusted so in the file app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss

  #side {
    ...
    ul {
      padding: 0;
      li {
->      color: #0f0;
        ...

Activity 2 exprimenting with number_to_currency helper method for ActionView.  You can change the
currency type to say pounds, lei, etc... and also the precision.

Activity 3 assert_select I am having difficulty with.

Activity 4 is always git done.
